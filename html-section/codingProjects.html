        <h2>
            Throughout my high school career and my university journey (thus far), I've developed several code-based projects in languages including Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and MATLAB!
            For the purposes of this site, I'll be showing my Python-based and Java-based projects. In addition, I'll be adding links where you can download the source code for some of my MATLAB projects.
            Also, feel free to see the source code for the Curve-Fitting Application on my Github!

                    Curve-Fitting Application
                    <p>
                        Designed with various Python libraries, including Streamlit (for the main app interface), NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, 
                        this app incorporates many different functions in one! This app can either take hand-inputted X, Y, and Z values, or it can read a CSV file and calculate several different types of curve fitting. 
                        It can do both 2D AND 3D Curve Fitting! Link is <a href= "https://fitting-data-app-ss.streamlit.app">here!</a>

                            <em>NOTE:</em> After a bit, the app goes to sleep. If you do encounter this, please click on the button shown on the screen and wait for a few moments.

                    Tic-Tac-Toe
                    <p>
                        Designed to be a GUI (Graphical User Interface) app (pops up in a separate window, not just in the terminal/console), I designed this version of Tic-Tac-Toe to be where two players (not vs. the computer) enter their names and battle out in
                        a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe! There is also the added functionality to restart the game. Link to download all necessary files to run this are on my Github <a href="https://github.com/Soham-Sasan-Codes-Wonders/Tic-Tac-Toe">respository.</a>
                        <p>
                            <em><u>NOTE:</u> As of yet, I have not added the ability to run Tic-Tac-Toe within this page itself. However, I do plan to add this in the future.. stay tuned!</em>
